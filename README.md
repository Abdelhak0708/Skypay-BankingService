Project Description:

In this project, we have two main classes: Operation and Account.
The Account class contains all the core logic of the application. I have implemented the methods related to account operations and included exception handling to manage invalid or unsupported use cases.

We also have a Main class that provides examples demonstrating how the methods in the Account class work in practice.

Additionally, I created a class called AccountTest to test the implemented methods. In this class, I verify the correct functioning of each method and ensure that exceptions are properly thrown and handled where necessary.
